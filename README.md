A player 1 can roll the dice and collect points until he gets number 1, if he gets number 1 then everything is canceled and the game moves to the next player. Each player, after rolling the dice, has the right to contain points by clicking on the hold button and the game moves to the next player. Whoever scores 100 points is the winner.
